# Introduction
Causal discovery algorithms infer the causal structure employing only observational data. Causal discovery is necessary to derive the causal model needed for performing causal inference and answering causal queries. Understanding and analyzing the causal relationships that exist among different features is crucial in several fields and applications like in the medical domain. In this paper, we perform the discovery and validation of causal relationships using medical observational data. State-of-the-art algorithms and conventional causal discovery techniques are compared using several evaluation metrics using synthetically generated data
