# Introduction
Causal Discovery or Causal Structure Discovery is the problem of identifying causal relationships from given data. Our study aims to examine the workings of various Causal Discovery algorithms. We compare the causal structures generated by each of the algorithms on four datasets, and evaluate the performance of the structures using evaluation metrics like ROC and AUC.
